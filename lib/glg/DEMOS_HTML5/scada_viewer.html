    <h4> WEB HMI / SCADA: GLG SCADA Viewer Web Demo (HTML5 & JavaScript)</h4>

    <p>This is a pure HTML5 and JavaScript example that demonstrates features
      used by typical <b>SCADA</b>, <b>HMI</b>, and <b>process control and
        monitoring</b> applications, with page navigation buttons integrated
      in the drawing.

    <h4><a id="overview" />Overview</h4>

    <p>This demo shows an <b>example of a SCADA Viewer application</b>
      deployed in a web browser using pure HTML5 and JavaScript.
      The SCADA Viewer loads <b>arbitrary drawings</b> created by the end users
      and updates them with data without any knowledge about the content of
      the drawings. As a result, no source code changes are required to
      add a new drawing or to add more objects into an existing drawing.</p>

    <p>The drawings are created with either the <b>GLG Graphics Builder</b> or
      <b>GLG HMI Configurator</b>, which allow a user to create graphical
      objects, define their dynamic behavior and the source of data for
      run time updates using a point-and-click interface, without the need
      to write graphics code by hand. The drawings are saved into files
      with a <i>.g</i> extension that are loaded and displayed on a web
      page using the GLG JavaScript Library.</p>

    <p>At run time, the SCADA Viewer loads the drawings, queries the list of
      data tags defined in each drawing and updates the drawings from the 
      datasources specified by the end user in the data tags.</p>

    <p>A <b>configuration file</b> is used to define a set of drawings to
      be displayed. On start-up, the Viewer reads the configuration file
      and initializes the navigation menu based on the information provided
      in the configuration file. A new drawing can be added to the Viewer by
      simply adding its filename to the configuration file. <b>Alternatively</b>,
      a list of available drawings can be queried from the server.</p>
    
    <p>A <b>page navigation menu</b> is implemented as part of the GLG drawing.
      <b>Alternatively</b>, navigation can be implemented using HTML buttons
      (as shown in
      <a href="scada_viewer_nav.html">another version of the Viewer</a>),
      or using an HTML list to display a list of pages.</p>
    
    <p>The Viewer uses a similar generic approach for defining popup dialogs
      to implement <b>drill-down</b> functionality. All information about the
      popup dialogs is defined in the drawing: a new popup dialog may be
      added by editing the drawing and without any changes to the source
      code of the Viewer.</p>

    <p>The demo also demonstrates the use of an integrated zooming and panning
      API. By default, it zooms and pans the drawing displayed in its viewing
      area. However, when the Real-Time Strip-Chart is activated by a
      corresponding button, the same code <b>zooms and scrolls the data
        displayed in the strip chart</b>.</p>

    <p>The demo uses simulated data. However, provided with a data source in
      a real application, it will display live data. The <i>GlgViewer</i>
      example in the <i>examples_html5</i> directory of the GLG installation
      provides an example of <b>using JSON for receiving data from a server</b>.
    </p>

    <p>The <b>GLG JavaScript Library</b> is used to deploy the drawing on a
      web page. The library provides an API to load and display the drawing,
      animate it with real-time data and handle user interaction.</p>
    
    <p>The GLG JavaScript Library implements full GLG run-time functionality
      present in the GLG C/C++, C# and Java libraries, allowing the
      same graphical page and programming logic to be shared between the desktop,
      web and mobile versions of an application. For example, this web demo has
      the same functionality as the corresponding desktop versions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Run-time initialization of the navigation menu.</b></li>
      
      <li><b>Switching between drawings</b> using navigation buttons.</li>
      
      <li>Querying <b>data tags</b> defined in the drawing and using them
        to update the display with a <b>real-time data feed</b>.</li>
      
      <li>Handling <b>object selection events</b> to open a <b>pop dialog</b>
        or a <b>menu</b> when an object of interest is selected with the mouse
        (or a touch on mobile devices).</li>
      
      <li>Implementing a <b>drill-down</b> functionality.</li>
      
      <li>Displaying a scrolling list of system <b>alarms</b> that can be
        acknowledged.</li>
      
      <li><b>Zooming and panning</b> the drawing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>User Interface</h4>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Click on a navigation button</b> on the left to display a
        corresponding drawing in the drawing area.</li>

      <li>Click on the <i>Alarms</i> button to display a popup dialog
        containing a scrolling list of system alarms. Click on an alarm row
        to acknowledge the alarm.</li>
      
      <li>On the <i>Water Treatment</i> page, click on any <b>motor icon</b>
        (green rectangle) to display a popup dialog containing additional
        information for the selected motor.</li>

      <li>On the <i>Real-Time Strip Chart</i> page, use the toolbar buttons
        to control the chart options.</li>
        
      <li>To display tooltips, hover the mouse over any button or an object
        on the <i>Solvent Recovery</i> page (touch and hold on mbile devices).
      </li>

      <li>On the <i>Test Object Commands</i> page, click on objects to
        perform actions described in the label above each object, such as:

        <p><ul>
          <li>popup a menu to chance the object state</li>
            
          <li>display a drill-down or real-time chart dialog</li>
          
          <li>send a command</li>
            
          <li>execute a GoTo command to navigate to a different page.</li>
          </ul></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Data Connectivity</h4>

    <p>The demo uses simulated data for animation. An application will
      use live data obtained from the server via asynchronous HTTP requests.
      </p>

    <p>The data connectivity between the graphics and custom data sources
      is implemented using tags defined in the drawing at design time in the
      GLG Builder or HMI Configurator. A tag is attached to a dynamic data
      driven parameter of a graphical object. The tag's TagSource property
      represents a data source variable from the back-end data acquisition
      system that drives the animation.</p>
    
    <p>An example of using asynchronous HTTP requests to query live data
      from a server in a JSON format may be found in the GlgViewer example in
      the examples_html5 directory of the GLG installation.
