    <h4> GLG Real-Time Chart Web Demo (HTML5 & JavaScript)</h4>

    <p>This pure HTML5 and JavaScript example demonstrates features of the
      GLG Real-Time Chart, such as handling <b>real-time updates</b> of hundreds
      of thousands of data points with <b>interactive zooming, scrolling</b>,
      data point selection and <b>chart tooltips</b>.
      <a href="#Features" >More features</a></p>
      
    <p>The demo loads a GLG drawing containing a real-time chart with
      interface controls and animates it with real-time data, handling
      chart zooming, scrolling and other user interaction. The drawing
      was created with an interactive <b>GLG Graphics Builder</b>.
      The GLG JavaScript Library provides an API for displaying the
      drawing on a web page, as well as supplying real-time data and
      handling user interaction.

    <h4><a name="Real_Time"></a>Real Time Updates and History Buffer</h4>

    <p>The chart keeps an <b>integrated history buffer</b> (with the
      size of 150000 data points in the online demo) and displays
      either all accumulated data or only the data points in the
      currently selected time span. The number of data points per
      line, the total number of points and the number of points
      visible in the currently selected time span is displayed at the
      bottom of the chart for demo purposes.</p>

    <p>In the real-time mode, the chart is updated with data,
      discarding the old data as necessary to maintain the requested
      size of the history buffer. The <b>buffer size can be increased
      or decreased at run time</b> without losing accumulated
      data. The size of the history buffer can be defined in terms of
      either a <b>time span</b> or a <b>number of data
      points</b>.</p>

    <p>On start up, the demo prefills the chart's history buffer with
      150K data samples to demonstrate the chart's scrolling
      capabilities.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="Scrolling"></a>Scrolling the Chart: Dragging, Scrollbars
      and Scroll Buttons </h4>

    <p>The chart can be scrolled in any direction (left, right, up or
      down) by <b>simply dragging it with the mouse</b>. To scroll the
      chart in only one direction (Time or Value), drag the Time or
      Value axis with the mouse. Dragging the chart data area scrolls
      the chart in both directions.<p>
      
    <p>Scrolling the chart by touch-dragging on <b>mobile devices</b>
      is disabled on this page by default to avoid interfering with
      page scrolling. Use the <b><i>Mobile Version</i> button</b>
      to see the mobile version with touch scrolling enabled by default.
      To scroll the data in the chart on mobile devices by touch on this page,
      press the <b><i>Enable Touch Dragging</i> button</b>, then touch and drag
      the chart. To repeat, press the button again. </p>

    <p>Alternatively, the chart can be scrolled left or right via the
      <i>Scroll Forward / Backward</i> toolbar buttons. </p>
    
    <p>If the chart's <i>AutoScroll</i> mode is off, a horizontal
      <b>scrollbar</b> at the bottom of the chart can also be used to
      scroll the chart along the Time axis. If the plots extend
      outside of the data area, the chart can be scrolled along the
      Value axis with the vertical scrollbar that automatically
      appears on the right side of the chart.</p>

    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">

      <li>Scrolling or dragging the chart disables automatic scrolling and
        activates <b>X or Y scrollbars</b> as necessary.</li>
      
      <li>To <b>scroll to the most recent data</b>, use the <i>Scroll to the
          Most Recent Data</i> toolbar button.</li>

      <li>The chart <b>keeps updating with new data</b> even if automatic
        scrolling is turned off. </li>

      <li>To <b>resume automatic scrolling</b>, click on the <i>Toggle
          AutoScroll</i> toolbar button.</li>

    </ul>

    <h4><a name="EnablingScroll"></a>Enabling or Disabling Chart Scrolling</h4>

    <p>The <b><i>ToggleAutoScroll</i></b> toolbar button enables or disables
      the chart's scrolling. The chart continues to accumulate new
      data even when scrolling is disabled. To see the most recent
      data, click on the <b><i>Show the Most Recent Data</i></b> button
      (move the mouse over a button to see a tooltip describing its function,
      or touch and hold a button on <b>mobile devices</b>).
    </p>
      
    <p>The <i>ToggleAutoScroll</i> button is disabled in the
      Historical and Calendar demo modes, as these modes do not update
      the chart with real-time data.</p>

    <h4><a name="Zooming"></a>Zooming and Range Lock</h4>

    <p>To zoom to an area, click on the <i>ZoomTo</i> toolbar button,
      then click and drag the mouse (or touch and drag on mobile devices)
      to define the area to zoom to. Use the <i>Reset Zoom</i> button
      ( <i>1:1</i> ) to reset the chart to the original state.</p>

    <p>The <i>Var2</i> plot displays binary <i>On/Off</i> data. The
      plot uses a <b>range lock</b> to prevent it from zooming in the
      vertical direction. The range lock allows the binary plot to
      keep its Y position, so that the user can zoom to an area of
      interest and view the other plots' data in the context of the
      binary <i>On/Off</i> data.</p>
   
    <h4><a name="ChangingSpan"></a>Changing Displayed Time Span and Custom
      Label Formatting</h4>

    <p>The toolbar buttons in the <b><i>Span</i></b> selector
      demonstrate examples of various time span intervals. The major
      and minor tick intervals of the time axis are changed
      dynamically to match the selected time span.</p>

    <p>In the <i>Calendar</i> demo mode, changing the displayed time
      span also changes the <b>format of the time axis labels</b>,
      demonstrating just a few of all possible label customization
      options. An application can also define <b>label and tooltip
      formatters</b> that will supply custom strings for axis labels
      and tooltips.</p>

    <h4><a name="Tooltips"></a>Tooltips, Data Point Selection and Cursor
      Feedback</h4>

    <p>When the cursor hovers over the data area (or the user touches and holds
      the chart area on mobile devices), a <b>tooltip displaying the value and
        the time stamp</b> of a data sample under the cursor automatically
      pops up. When a tooltip is displayed, the <b>selected data sample is
        highlighted in the chart</b>.</p>

    <p>In addition to a tooltip, information about a point under the cursor is
      displayed at the top of the chart on every mouse (or touch) move,
      demonstrating the <b>chart selection API</b>.</p>

    <p>The <i>ToggleAutoScroll</i> button may be used to disable the
      chart's <i>AutoScroll</i> while using the tooltips. If <i>AutoScroll</i>
      is not disabled, the selected sample will scroll out of view as the chart
      receives new data.</p>

    <p>When the cursor hovers over the Time or Value axis (or the user touches
      and holds the an axis), the <b>axis tooltip</b> displays the time stamp
      or the Y value corresponding to the cursor position on the selected axis.
    </p>

    <p>An <b>integrated cross-hair</b> is displayed when the cursor is
      inside the data area. The cross-hair feedback can be turned on
      or off, as well as changed to show only a horizontal or vertical
      line.</p>

    <p>Tooltips can be configured to define the content and the format
      of the tooltip. An API for selecting and querying data points at
      run time is also available.</p>

    <h4><a name="Historical"></a>Real-Time, Historical and Calendar Demo Modes
    </h4>

    <p>The first toolbar button changes the demo mode:</p>

    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">

      <li><b>RealTime</b> mode updates the chart with a continuous
        data stream. In the demo, the chart receives new data every
        30 milliseconds and scrolls to display new data if <i>AutoScroll</i>
        is <i>ON</i>.</li>
      
      <li><b>Historical</b> mode scrolls through a large array of
        logged data accumulated at 1 minute intervals.</li>

      <li><b>Calendar</b> mode displays daily data accumulated over a
          period of many years.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>The total time extent of data in the chart's history buffer
      depends on the size of the history buffer and the update
      interval between data samples.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="TimeStamps"></a>Time Stamps and Handling of Invalid Data
      Points</h4>
    
    <p>The chart can display data points positioned at uneven time intervals.
      When displaying real-time or historical data, each data point is
      <b>positioned according to its time stamp</b>. If no time stamp
      is provided, the current time is used by the chart to position
      the data point. An option to display evenly distributed data
      points is also available.</p>

    <p>The chart handles invalid data points and displays them as
      <b>gaps in the plots</b>. A data point may be tagged as invalid
      by setting its <i>Valid</i> flag to <i>False.</i></p>

    <p>In the demo, the <i>Var1</i> plot contains invalid data points
      which are shown as gaps in the plot.</p>

    <h4><a name="Legend_Selection"></a>Legend Item Selection</h4>

    <p>The GLG API may be used to determine <b>which legend item was selected
        with the mouse</b>. In the demo, clicking on a legend item <b>highlights
        the corresponding plot</b> by increasing its line width. To unhighlight,
      click of the legend item again.</p>

    <h4><a name="Erasing"></a>Erasing and Showing a Plot</h4>

    <p>Any plot in a chart can be <b>dynamically switched on or
        off </b>at run time without losing accumulated data.  When a
        plot is turned off, it is automatically removed from the
        chart's legend. The Y axis associated with the plot can be
        turned on or off as well. A plot keeps accumulating new data
        in its history buffer even if it is turned off. </p>

    <p>In the demo, the <i>Var2</i> plot displays binary data which do
      not have much meaning in the <i>Calendar</i> demo mode. The plot
      and the Y axis associated with it are erased in the <i>Calendar</i> mode
      and shown again when the demo is switched to other modes.</p>

    <h4><a name="MultipleAxes"></a>Multiple Y Axes and Axis Label Layout</h4>
    
    <p>The chart can display multiple Y axes and provides multiple options for
      positioning a label that annotates each axis. The <i>Toggle Labels</i>
      button at the bottom of the chart toggles through several options of
      Y axis label positioning.</p>

    <p>The number of Y axes and visibility of each axis can be changed
      at run-time as well.</p>
