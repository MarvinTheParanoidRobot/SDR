    <h4>GIS Map Server and Air Traffic Monitoring Web Demo (HTML5 & JavaScript)
    </h4>

    <p>This is an example of a <b>GIS monitoring application written entirely
        in JavaScript</b> using the GLG Extended API. The demo demonstrates      
      the use of the <b>GLG Map Server</b> integrated inside of a GLG drawing
      as a GLG GIS Object. The Map Server is used to generate the background map,
      while the GLG Toolkit is used to <b>display dynamic icons on top of the
        map</b> and handle user interaction.
      <a href="#info" >More information</a></p>

    <p>The demo uses a simple image dataset. More detailed datasets, such as
      an <a href="http://www.genlogic.com/rel38.html#Open_Street_Map_Dataset">
        <b>Open Street Map dataset (OSM)</b></a>, may be used depending on the
      application needs.</p>

                padding: 0px;"> 
    </div>

    <p>The demo uses <b>asyncronous map loading</b>: when the map is zoomed or
      scrolled, the drawing is changed to the the new zoom or pan state right
      away, while the new map will appear when it's loaded.
      The <a href="airtraffic_demo.html">GIS Air Traffic Control Demo</a>
      demonstrates an <b>alternative approach</b> that uses an
      <b>asynchronous map loading request</b> to load a map: when the map is
      zoomed or scrolled, the program will continue to operate in the old zoom
      or pan state and will switch to the new zoom or pan when the new map
      is ready.</p>
    
    <p><a name="info"></a>
      The JavaScript version of the demo provides the same functionality as
      the desktop versions written in C/C++, C# and Java. The GLG drawing and
      the programming logic are shared between all versions of the demo, with
      only syntax differences between the source code of different versions.
      The <a href="http://www.genlogic.com/download.html">GLG Demo Download</a>
      includes the desktop versions of this demo.</p>

    <h4><a name="Overview"></a>Overview </h4>

    <p>The demo uses two map windows. The main window shows a <b>detailed map</b>
      which can be zoomed and panned. The <b>thumbnail</b> window displays
      the whole world in the Orthographic Projection (<b>a globe view</b>)
      and shows the outline of the area displayed in the detailed map window.</p>

    <p>Each moving icon is represented by a collection of dynamic GLG
      objects which may change shape, label, colors and other attributes to
      reflect the state of the object they represent. Each icon can be
      selected with the mouse and displays a tooltip with detailed information
      when the mouse is moved over it (touch and hold on mobile devices).</p>

    <p>The demo starts with the map of the whole world, then zooms on the
      United States to show more details. The map can be zoomed with the zoom
      buttons located in the toolbar. The directional buttons in the upper left
      corner may be used to scroll the map. Either map can also be scrolled
      by dragging it with the mouse (or touch on mobile devices).</p>

    <p>In addition to the moving icons, the map also contains several static
      city icons implemented as GLG objects (square green dots). These city
      icons are different from the city markers generated in the map image by
      the Map Server. The city icons generated by the Map Server are part of the
      image, can not be selected, and can be switched on or off only by
      changing the visibility of the city layer and re-generating the image.
      The city icons implemented as GLG objects, on the other hand, can be
      switched dynamically on or off, can change color and other attributes,
      and may be selected with the mouse. They also display tooltips with
      detailed information when the mouse moves over them and may be used
      by an application to annotate special points of interests.</p>

    <h4><a name="Dataset_Info"></a>Dataset Information</h4>

    <p>The demo uses several datasets arranged in multiple layers.</p>
    <ui>
      <li>The <b>NASA's satellite image of the Earth</b> is used for the
        view of the whole world.</li>

      <li>A higher-resolution <b>tiled version</b> of the image is used when
        the map is zoomed in.</li>

      <li>The <b>Digital Chart of the World (DCW VMAP0)</b> vector dataset is
        used for high-level zooms.</li>
      
      <li>The <b>US Census Tiger</b> dataset is used for the street-level
        zooms in the US area.
      </li>

      <p>The DCW dataset provides details of political and provincial boundaries,
        inland water, roads, railroads, populated areas and other coverage.
        The DCW and Tiger datasets are organized in such a way that more
        detailed layers are automatically activated depending on the zoom level,
        to display more details as the map is zoomed in.</p>

      <p>An <a href="http://www.genlogic.com/rel38.html#Open_Street_Map_Dataset">
          <b>Open Street Map dataset (OSM)</b></a> that contains vector data for
        the whole Earth down to the street level and buildings details is also
        available for the use with the GLG Map Server.</p>

      <h4><a name="User_Interface"></a>User Interface</h4>

      <p>Move the mouse over an icon to display a <b>tooltip</b> with icon
        information. On mobile devices, touch and hold an icon to display a
        tooltip.</p>

      <p>Move the mouse over either map window (or touch the map on mobile
        devices) to <b>display the lat/lon coordinates</b> of the cursor (touch)
        in the lower right corner of the main map.</p>

      <p>Click on the moving icon to <b>select</b> it (an application may also
        open another URL with detailed information for the selected icon).
      </p>

      <p>Click on the left-most button in the toolbar to <b>"lock"</b> on the
        selected icon, so that the map is automatically panned to keep the
        selected icon visible as it is moving.</p>

      <p>The toolbar also contains buttons for <b>switching various layers</b>
        on and off, changing the plane icon size, as well as
        <b>zooming and panning</b> controls. The toolbar displays tooltips when
        the mouse is moved over toolbar buttons. On <b>mobile devices</b>,
        tooltips are activated by a touch and hold action.</p>

      <p><b>NOTE:</b> To run the demo locally from your own server, the
        GLG Map Server has to be setup on that server. If the map server
        is not set up, the map image will be missing.</p>
