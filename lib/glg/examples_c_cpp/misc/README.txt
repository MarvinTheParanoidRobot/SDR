This directory contains additional GLG examples which are written using
GLG Generic API. Some of the examples use the functionality of the 
GLG Extended API.

RealTimeChart/GlgRealTimeChartG.c           (Standard API)
RealTimeChart/GlgRealTimeChartG_IntAPI.c    (Intermediate API)
    Demostrates the use of the GLG real-time strip chart and its interactive
    capabilities. 

RealTimeChart_cpp/
    The C++ version of the GLG real-time strip chart example.

RealTimeChartAlarm
    In addition to the functionality shown in the RealTimeChart example,
    this example also demonsrates how to handle GLG Alarms using a global
    Alarm handler. The alarms are added to the chart's plots in 
    the GLG Builder.

RTChartMarkerFeedback
     In addition to the functionality shown in the RealTimeChart example,
     this example also demonsrates how to show/hide a marker for a data sample
     selected with a double click. 

LineGraph2D/
    Demonstrates how to use the GLG 2D Line Graph widget.

ConstrainAttributes/GlgConstrainG.c
    Demonstrates how to constrain object attributes.
    Uses functions of the Extended API.

CustomData/GlgCustomDataG.c
    Demonstrates how to add custom properties to an object,
    such as custom MouseClickEvent and TooltipString, as well as custom
    DataValue property of the D (double) type.
    Uses functions of the Extended API.

ObjectSelection/GlgObjectSelectionG.c
    Demonstrates how to handle GLG object selection with the mouse
    using Custom events, such as MouseClickEvent and MouseOverEvent.     

ObjectCreateAndMove/GlgObjCreateAndMoveG.c
    Demonstrates the following features:
      - the use of the Trace callback;
      - how to create a polygon object using the mouse;
      - how to add an object to the drawing;
      - how to traverse a container object, such as a polygon;
      - how to convert screen coordinates to world coordinates;
      - how to select and move objects with the mouse.
    This example demonstrates the use of the GLG Extended API. 

ObjectPosition/GlgObjectPositionG.c
    Demonstrates the following features:
      - the use of the Trace callback;
      - how extract an icon from a palette button;
      - how to place an object in the drawing;
      - how to position the object using the mouse;
      - how to scale and move an object.
    This example demonstrates the use of the GLG Extended API. 

Blinking/GlgBlinkingExampleG.c
    Demonstrates how to use integrated blinking feature of the 
    GLG Toolkit.

ListWidget/GlgListExampleG.c
    Demonstrates how to use GLG List Widget, handle input events
    occured in the widget, as well as use the list widget's messages
    to query the list widget's settings and modify its items.

OptionMenu/GlgOptionMenuG.c
    Demonstrates how to use GLG OptionMenu Widget and its messages.

TagsExample/GlgTagsExampleG.c
    Demonstrates how to use GLG tags feature to query a list of tags
    defined in a drawing, and use them to animate the drawing with data.

GIS/GlgGISExampleG.c
    Demonstrates how to integrate GIS mapping functionality with the 
    dynamic features of the GLG Toolkit. It uses the GLG GIS object to
    display a map generated by the GLG Map Server, and shows how to 
    display a dynamic icon on top of the map.

    This example uses the Extended API, but it can be rewritten to use 
    the Standard API only.

GIS2/GlgGISExampleG2.c
    Demonstrates how to integrate GIS mapping functionality with the 
    dynamic features of the GLG Toolkit. In addition to the previous 
    example, it also shows how to position an array of icons defined
    by their lat/lon coordinates, select them with the mouse and 
    calculate distances on the map, as well as how to toggle map layers
    based on user requests.

SCADAViewer_cpp/GlgSCADAViewer.cpp
    The C++ version version of the the SCADA Viewer Demo.
    The C version is located in the <glg_dir>/DEMOS/SCADA_demo directory.
