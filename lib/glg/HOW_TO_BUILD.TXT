BUILDING GLG DEMOS AND EXAMPLES ON UNIX/LINUX

The src directory of the GLG installation contains two sample gmake makefiles 
for building GLG programs:

   <glg_dir>/src/makefile
   <glg_dir>/src/makefile2

The first make file (makefile) builds an executable using all source files in 
the current directory and can be used in directories that contain files of a 
single demo or example.

The second make file (makefile2) uses only the source files
explicitely listed in the make file and may be used to build individual 
examples in directories that contain source files of several examples.

By default, makefiles assume that GLG is installed in /usr/local/glg and 
build executables with the filename defined by the TARGET variable (set to 
"demo" by default). The makefiles can be edited as needed to use different 
paths for the include files and libraries, as well as to modify other settings.

For the EVALUATION version of the GLG Toolkit, modify the GLG_LIB variable 
in the makefile as described in the comments.

To build a GLG executable, copy an appropriate makefile into the directory
that contains source files, modify it as needed following the comments in
the makefile, then build and run the project:

      cd <project_dir>
      # Copy either makefile or makefile2
      cp <glg_dir>/src/makefile .
      # Edit makefile as needed
      make
      ./demo

ADDITIONAL LINUX PACKAGES

To link GLG C/C++ programs on Linux, the following packages need to be installed:

  libx11-dev libxt-dev libxext-dev libxmu-dev

To link with the Motif-based GLG libraries, the following package is 
also required:

  libmotif-dev

For the Raspberry Pi Linux, the Motif library (libXm.a) is supplied
with the Toolkit in the GLG lib directory, and the libmotif-dev package
is not required.
