# This configuration file is used to populate the navigation menu dynamically
# at run-time. The file specifies a list of drawings to be used in the
# SCADA Viewer. 
#
# The file uses a simple comma-separated format for the ease of parsing. 
# Each row defines information for a menu item and includes the following 
# fields:
#    LabelString, DrawingName, TooltipString, Title,
#
# Each row must include a terminating comma at the end. The leading and 
# trailing spaces will be removed by the parsing code.
