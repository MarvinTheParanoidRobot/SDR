<h2> <font face="Arial">
GIS Map Server and Air Traffic Demo:<br>
<font color="#aa0000">Add Dynamics to Your Maps!</font>
</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">
This demo presents an example of using the <a
 href="http://www.genlogic.com/products.html#Map_Server">
<b>GLG Map Server</b></a>
integrated inside of a GLG drawing as a <b>GLG GIS Object</b>. The Map
Server is used to generate the map of the viewed area, while the
Toolkit is used to <span style="font-weight: bold;">display dynamic
icons on top of the map</span>, handle user
interaction and automatically generate Map Server requests to
re-generate the image when the map is panned or zoomed.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
The demo uses several datasets arranged in multiple layers,
automatically <b>switching to more detailed datasets</b> as needed
when the map is zoomed in. <a href="#Dataset_Info">Click here for more
information on the datasets used in the demo</a>.

<h4><font face="Arial"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">
The demo uses two map windows. The main window shows a <b>detailed map</b>
which can be zoomed and panned. The <b>thumbnail</b> window displays
the whole world in the Orthographic Projection (a globe view) and shows
the outline of the area displayed in the detailed map window.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
Each moving icon is represented by a collection of dynamic GLG
objects which may change shape, label, colors and other attributes to
reflect the state of the object they represent. Each icon can be
selected with the mouse and displays a tooltip with detailed
information when the mouse is moved over it.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
The demo starts with the map of the whole world, then zooms on the
United
States to show more details. The map can be zoomed with the zoom
buttons located in the toolbar. The toolbar displays tooltips when the
mouse is moved over toolbar buttons. The directional buttons in the
upper left corner may be used to scroll the map.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
In addition to the moving icons, the map also contains several static
city icons implemented as GLG objects (square green dots). These city
icons are
different from the city markers generated in the map image by the Map
Server. The city icons generated by the Map Server are part of the
image, can not be selected, and can be switched on or off only by
changing the visibility of the city layer and re-generating
the image. The city icons implemented as GLG objects, on the other
hand, can be switched dynamically on or off, can change color and other
attributes, and may be selected with the mouse. They also display
tooltips with
detailed information when the mouse moves over them and may be used by
an
application to annotate special points of interests.

<h4><font face="Arial">
<a name="Dataset_Info"></a>Dataset Information
</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">
The demo uses several datasets arranged in multiple layers. <br>
<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<li>The <b>NASA's satellite image of the Earth</b> is used for the
view of the whole world.
</li>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<li>A higher-resolution <b>tiled version</b> of the image is used when
the map is zoomed in.
</li>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<li>The <b>Digital Chart of the World (VMAP0)</b> vector dataset is
used for high-level zooms.<br>
  <br>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;The <span style="font-weight: bold;">US Census Tiger</span>
dataset is used for the street-level zooms in the US area.<br>
</li>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The DCW dataset provides details of political and
provincial boundaries, inland water, roads, railroads, populated areas
and other coverage. The DCW and Tiger datasets are organized in such a
way that more detailed layers are
automatically activated depending on the zoom level, to display more
details as the map is zoomed in.
</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial"><a name="User_Interface"></a>User Interface</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"> Move the mouse over an
icon to display a <b>tooltip</b> with icon information.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> Move the mouse over either map window to <b>display
the
lat/lon
coordinates</b> of the cursor in the lower right corner of
the main map.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Click on the moving icon
to <b>select</b> it (an application may also open another URL with
detailed information for the selected icon).
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Click on the left-most
button in the toolbar to <b>"lock"</b> on the selected icon, so that
the map is automatically panned to keep the selected icon visible as it
is moving.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The toolbar also contains
buttons for <b>switching various layers </b>on and off, changing
plane icon size, as well as <b>zooming and panning</b> controls. The
toolbar displays tooltips when the mouse is moved over toolbar buttons.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>NOTE: To run the demo locally from your own
server, the GLG Map Server has to be setup on that server. If the map
server is not
set up, the map image will be missing.</b></font></p>
